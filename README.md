</p>


## Instructions

•	Guess game works well with the new “windows terminal” https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701 this has emoji support. A regular terminal “cmd” also works, but emoji wont display properly.

•	It also works on visual studio code. (might also need windows terminal from MS Store if doesn’t display emoji)

•	A lucky charm for guessing the boxes.
